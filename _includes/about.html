        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="lead">My name is Ryan Reiss. I am 23, a dual citizen (US-CAN), and am currently living in British Columbia, Canada as I am in my final year at the University of British Columbia.
                        For as long as I can remember, I have always been playing video games, and for that reason around 11 years ago I decided to start learning how to program C to make my own games.
                        Since then, I have been making games in my free time and fine tuning my coding skills professionally, alongside learning multiple programming languages (C, C++, Java, C#, Python) in my time at University.
                        Since I am soon graduating this May, I am finally at the point where I now want to take my career to the next level.
